# Description

Our dashboard contains data from the "Global Graduate Skills & Employability Index".
Its goal is to help potential future students and, potentially, their academic advisors
investigate the types of educational programs they are interested in by providing
location, university, and employment data in an accessible manner.

**The data can be accessed via this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zulqarnain11/global-graduate-skills-and-employability-index).**

Alternatively, there is a [static copy](data/raw/global_graduate_employability_index.csv) of the data as of 2026-02-10 in the current repository.
