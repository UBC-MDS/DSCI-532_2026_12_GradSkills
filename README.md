# Graduate Skills Employment Dashboard

Our dashboard contains data from the "Global Graduate Skills & Employability Index".
Its goal is to help potential future students and, potentially, their academic advisors
investigate the types of educational programs they are interested in by providing
location, university, and employment data in an accessible manner.

It will contain several filters to allow the user to filter on location, degree level,
and industry. In addition, the user will be able to visualize key employment KPIs such
as employment rate and average starting salaries.
