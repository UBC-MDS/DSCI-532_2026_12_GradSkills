# Milestone 1 Proposal

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

**Our Role:** Data science consultants designing an interactive employment analytics dashboard.

**Target Audience:** Prospective students, recent graduates, career advisors, and university administrators.

We are building this dashboard for individuals who need to interpret graduate employment outcomes to support academic and career decision-making. These users include:

- Prospective students deciding on a field of study or degree level
- Recent graduates evaluating job market outcomes across industries and regions
- Career advisors guiding students using outcome-based evidence
- University administrators assessing program performance

Our role is to translate multi-dimensional employment data into an accessible and interactive visual tool.

![App Sketch](../img/dashboard-mockup-commentary.png)

This app contains several types of visualizations related to employment outcomes
of different university programs. Featured are summary statistics, trends,
and overall rankings. These are illustrated with the cards at the top that aggregate
the underlying data to provide the user with a high-level unfiltered overview.

On the left-sided sidebar, the first two filters allow the user to select
what location they are interested in - with 'Country' allowing for more granularity
when compared to 'Region'. The user can apply the subsequent two filters to select the
field and industries of their choice. The 'Graduation Year' slider provides the user
the ability to investigate different date ranges they may be interested in or, for
example, a more recent period. All filters will update the visuals on the right.

The center charts each provide a breakdown of a specific aspect of the dataset. The
doughnut chart depicts the proportion of degree levels. Additionally, there are two
bar charts to highlight popular universities and industries. And, finally, the user
will be able to gauge the starting salary trend over time.
